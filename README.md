# Overview
Extremely basic review carousel with the purpose on expanding my JavaScript knowledge. First use of JavaScript objects &amp; SASS. SASS was very enjoyable to learn, along with JavaScript in this very basic project. 

## Description
For my third project, I decided to create a basic carousel of reviews/testimonials. I also decided to pick up another technology, SASS. I really love using SCSS instead of CSS, as I find it much more organised and functional.

### What I learned about JavaScript
I learned about the use of objects and how to manipulate the DOM using event listeners and functions.

* Using functions & arrow functions
* Destructuring objects
* Using the .length method to create a loop
* How live updates are made to the page

### What I learned about SASS

* Indentation
* Variables
* Hierarchy
* SASS --> CSS conversion
* SCSS vs SASS formatting/syntax

### Things to be improved
This project took slightly longer than the other two previous projects, due to there being more code, as well as learning about SASS.
